I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at **CERDI**, University of Clermont Auvergne (CNRS, IRD).  
My research focuses on:

- fiscal federalism and decentralization in India;
- ethnic conflicts and institutional arrangements;
- the impact of public policies on local governance.

I have also worked on indirect taxation, budget transparency, and digitalization issues such as P2P and G2P payments in public finance.
