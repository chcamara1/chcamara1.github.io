I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at **CERDI**, University of Clermont Auvergne (CNRS, IRD).  
My research focuses on:

- fiscal federalism and decentralization in India;
- ethnic conflicts and institutional arrangements;
- the impact of public policies on local governance.

I have also worked on indirect taxation, budget transparency, and digitalization issues such as P2P and G2P payments in public finance.

 I am also deeply interested in fiscal competition within monetary and economic unions. I am committed to balancing the roles of the public and private sectors, recognizing that both are essential for economic prosperity. I believe economic policies should be approached holistically, considering the complex interactions between them to effectively achieve policy objectives.
 Beyond my primary fields of interest, I am also keen on geopolitics, football, judo, and military matters.
