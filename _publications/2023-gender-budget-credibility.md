This study examines the effects of gender budgeting on fiscal policy in Indian states (1991–2020) using Difference-in-Differences and alternative estimators. It shows that states adopting gender budgeting increase spending in inclusive sectors like education and infrastructure. The policy improves the credibility of public action and women's outcomes, but may constrain fiscal autonomy.
